# mindfuelAPP
Put all the files that I have uploaded underneath one folder and press on the feed page to start. 
It is recommened that you use chrome or firefox because some parts of the code do not work well on safari. 
WHEN SIGNING UP please use username = username1 and password = username and email = username@gmail.com because I have yet to learn how to make it a fully functional website.
Thank you :)

I hope that in the future I can make this app fully functional and to replace the game center with a tycoon builder like tiny towers or animal crossing. Where points that are achieved act like a currency that can buy things to help build your area. As well as making the tycoon builder interactive with other users.
